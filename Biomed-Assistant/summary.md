As a biomedical research assistant, I can provide you with a consolidated summary of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. Based on the provided articles, here are some potential therapeutic approaches:

1. **Flavonoids**: Flavonoids have been shown to regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome and may be used as a treatment strategy to target inflammation in Alzheimer's disease.
2. **NLRP3 inhibitors**: Inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome may help reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.
3. **Anti-inflammatory agents**: Flavonoids, as well as other anti-inflammatory compounds, may help reduce chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease.
4. **Biologics**: Biologic therapies targeting specific proteins or pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid-β or tau, may be effective in slowing disease progression.
5. **Small molecules**: Small molecule therapeutics targeting specific enzymes or receptors involved in Alzheimer's disease, such as BACE1 or APP, may help reduce amyloid-β production and slow disease progression.

Please note that these are just potential therapeutic approaches based on the provided articles and should not be considered a comprehensive list of all possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
