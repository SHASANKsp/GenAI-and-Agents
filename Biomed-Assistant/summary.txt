As a biomedical research assistant, I can consolidate the information related to Alzheimer's disease from the provided abstracts. Here is a list of potential therapeutic targets or approaches that may be relevant for Alzheimer's disease:

1. **Autophagy modulators**: The study on autophagy and herpesvirus suggests that altered autophagic function may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Modulating autophagy through therapeutics could potentially impact the progression of the disease.
2. **Viral susceptibility modifiers**: The study on coupling Alzheimer's disease genetic risk factors with viral susceptibility and inflammation implies that modifying viral susceptibility or reducing the impact of viral infections might be beneficial for Alzheimer's disease patients.
3. **Inflammation modulators**: The same study suggests that abnormal inflammatory responses may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Modulating inflammation through therapeutics could potentially slow down disease progression.

Please note that these potential therapeutic targets are based on the provided abstracts and require further research and validation before being considered as viable treatment options for Alzheimer's disease.
